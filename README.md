# Kali Linux Extreme Performance Script

A fully automated, reversible performance optimization script for **Kali Linux**.  
It applies system-level tweaks to improve responsiveness, reduce boot time, and optimize low-RAM or slow systems.

**Warning:**  
This script makes aggressive system changes. Use only if you understand what you're doing or on a test machine.  
A full revert script is automatically generated.
